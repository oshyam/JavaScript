# JavaScript

## This repo shows JavaScript example from basics to Intermidiate to Advance.
Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example is the
typeof operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value
you give it.
console.log(typeof 4.5)
// → number
console.log(typeof "x")
// → string
